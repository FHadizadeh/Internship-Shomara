# Indexing and Search Persian Addresses using the ElasticSearch

This repo contains my internship project.
I implemented a retrieval system for Persian address data using Elasticsearch and a search UI using Flask.

## Run the project
To run the project, run the following command. It takes several minutes to pull the Elasticsearch image for the first run. It takes a while to create containers and set up the network, and run the servers.  Navigate the http://localhost:5000/ to see the search box.

`docker-compose up`
